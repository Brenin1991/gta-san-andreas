                        <p>Five years ago Carl Johnson escaped from the pressures of life in Los Santos,
                        San Andreas... a city tearing itself apart with gang trouble, drugs and corruption.
                        Where filmstars and millionaires do their best to avoid the dealers and gangbangers.</p>
                    
                        <p>Now, it's the early 90s. Carl's got to go home. His mother has been murdered,
                        his family has fallen apart and his childhood friends are all heading towards
                        disaster.</p>

                        <p>On his return to the neighborhood, a couple of corrupt cops frame him for homicide.
                        CJ is forced on a journey that takes him across the entire state of San Andreas,
                        to save his family and to take control of the streets.</p>

                        <p>Liberty City. Vice City. Now San Andreas, a new chapter in the legendary series.
                        Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is available now for PlayStation®2,
                        Xbox®, PC and select Mobile devices.</p>

                        <p>The city lies in the middle of the desert and boasts many resorts and casinos,
                        as does its royal counterpart. Las Venturas is located at the northwest end of San Andreas,
                        west of Bone County and north of Red County and Los Santos.</p>

                        <p>Los Santos is the capital of San Andreas and is located in the southeastern
                        part of San Andreas. It is a busy city inhabited by various types of people and several
                        neighborhoods. Ganton to the east and Los Flores to the northeast are the
                        "slums" of the city, Richman and Mulholland are the richest part; Rodeo appeals
                        to the rich, while Jefferson and Little Mexico are the city's poor areas with cheap shops,
                        the city has a port economy, and its GDP is $ 64.79 billion in 1992.</p>

                        <p>San Fierro is the smallest (and most urbanized) San Andreas metropolitan area,
                        and is located on the peninsula in the western part of the state. In the south of the
                        city is Mount Chiliad and the town of Angel Pine in Whetstone. North of the city,
                        through a recreation of the famous Golden Gate Bridge (Gant Bridge), lies the small
                        town of Bayside, and to the northwest of the city, is the municipality of Tierra Robada.
                        San Fierro is a city of moderate size, with the beautiful bay of San Fierro to the north
                        and the Panopticon to the east. The city is connected to Los Santos and Las Venturas by
                        highways and railways, as well as air transportation.</p>
